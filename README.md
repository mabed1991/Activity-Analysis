This report is a course project within the Practical Machine Learning Course on the Data Science Specialization by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

In this report, we are describing how a machine learning algorithm was built to predict the manner in which 6 participants did an exercise. Using cross validation, specifying what the expected out of sample error was, and why some choices were made. This prediction model was also used to predict 20 different test cases
